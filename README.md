I've engineered four distinct RAG models, each showcasing unique advantages and drawbacks. For indexing, I've carefully designed 4 methods ([indexing strategy functions](source/index_utils.py)) to organize and structure the "1300 Towards Data Science Medium Articles" dataset, making it easy to search and find specific articles. For retrieval, I've built strong systems ([RAG models implementation](source/rag_model.py)) that uses RAG to find and provide relevant parts of articles. I've also made sure to break down the articles into smaller sections in a smart way to ensure that the returned fragments have just the right amount of information.

I presented and compared the results of the models in [models validation notebook](notebooks/model_validation.ipynb). Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, I believe the best model is the Sentence Window Model. It boasts excellent Groundedness, Answer Relevance, and satisfactory Context Relevance metrics. It also has a low Total Cost, but slightly higher latency. The other models might prove to be a better choice for specific use cases. Interestingly, the model created using Context Chat also yielded promising results.
