- Engineered four distinct RAG models, each showcasing unique advantages and drawbacks.
- Designed four methods ([indexing strategy functions](source/index_utils.py)) to organize and structure the "1300 Towards Data Science Medium Articles" dataset, facilitating efficient searchability and accessibility.
- Developed robust retrieval systems ([RAG models implementation](source/rag_model.py)) utilizing RAG to locate and provide relevant article fragments promptly.
- Implemented smart chunking strategies to break down articles into smaller sections, ensuring optimal balance between fragment length and content richness.
- Presented and compared the results of the models in [models validation notebook](notebooks/model_validation.ipynb).
