    "**Paragraph**: According to the Neuron Doctrine, the neuron is the fundamental structural and functional unit of the brain. Neurons pass information to other neurons in the form of electrical impulses from dendrites to axon via cell body. This requires maintenance of ionic potential difference between inside and outside which takes up around 20 % of the daily glucose consumption of the body. Myelin sheath aides in fast lossless long-distance communication of electrical impulses spikes by wrapping around the axon. This happens by a mechanism called Saltatory Conduction where the spike hops from one Node of Ranvier (myelin-sheath gaps) to the other. This show how beautifully the brain encompasses the concept of lossless signal transmission. Connections between two neurons is called a synapse which can be of electrical and chemical nature both. Electrical for fast transmission for functions such as reflex, chemical for learning and memory. Firing the neurons is an energy-intensive process hence all neurons are not firing at the same time. This signals that there might be an amazing energy optimising scheduling algorithm embedded in the brain. The concept of weights in the neural networks probably was inspired from the concept of Hebbian Plasticity which is often understood as Cells that fire together wire together. There are various important components of the brain and each of them are connected with each other. The most interesting one for me is Thalamus which is like a base station, takes the input signals from our sensory organs and then passes it onto the cerebral cortex which is often called the star of the show. The brain is great when it comes to resource management. Many of the tasks that the brain performs are done unconsciously because of which we can multitask something like massive parallel computing. There are many sub networks of neurons that also forms part of a bigger network and connected to smaller networks as well. When it comes to learning and memory brain has different ways in place.\n"

By broadening the retrieval scope, the model gains access to a wider context, facilitating the generation of more accurate and contextually relevant responses (image below). As a result, the model can capture long-range dependencies and nuances in the given prompt, leading to improved overall performance."

      "Response: The What-If Tool is designed for speedy machine learning analytics, aimed at accelerating iterative model development and training. It allows users to get a quick look at their model performance and data during ML/AI development. The tool is not meant for novices and requires basic knowledge of Python and notebooks. It is considered an excellent accelerant for practicing analysts and ML engineers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Transfer Learning?\n",
      "Response: Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed on a second related task. This approach is particularly useful when the second task has less data available for training. By leveraging knowledge from the first task, the model can achieve better performance on the second task compared to training from scratch.\n",

      "Question:  What is the problem of Reinforcement Learning\n",
      "Response: The main problem in Reinforcement Learning is the issue of credit assignment, where the agent must determine which actions contributed to the received reward. This problem becomes challenging in cases where rewards are delayed or sparse, making it difficult for the agent to associate actions with outcomes accurately.\n",

      "\n",
      "Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models explain a given time series based on its own past values, including lags and lagged forecast errors. ARIMA models are suitable for non-seasonal time series data that exhibit patterns and are not random white noise.\n",

Tableau allows users to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and reports without requiring extensive technical expertise. Its drag-and-drop functionality, wide range of visualization options, and ability to connect to various data sources make it a preferred choice for data visualization and analysis tasks.\n",

For indexing, I've carefully designed 4 methods (source/index_utils.py) to organize and structure the \"1300 Towards Data Science Medium Articles\" dataset, making it easy to search and find specific articles. For retrieval, I've built strong systems (source/rag_model.py) that uses RAG to find and provide relevant parts of articles. I've also made sure to break down the articles into smaller sections in a smart way to ensure that the returned fragments have just the right amount of information. \n",

It boasts excellent Groundedness, Answer Relevance, and satisfactory Context Relevance metrics. It also has a low Total Cost, but slightly higher latency. The other models might prove to be a better choice for specific use cases. Interestingly, the model created using Context Chat also yielded promising results."
